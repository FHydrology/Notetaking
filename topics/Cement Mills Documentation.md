### Cement Mills Project Documentation:

#### Catchment Sim:
- [CatchmentSIM Tutorial 01 Link](https://csse.com.au/csim_online_help/tutorial_1.html)
- The catchment elevation data that was input into CatchmentSim was a STRM 1 second DEM file.
- The outlet was determined to be at the downstream section of the bridge. 
- The catchment was subdivided into 5 different sections. **However this is subject to change dependent on Evan's advice.**
