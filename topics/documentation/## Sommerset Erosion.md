#### Section 1: Terrain and Cross-Sections
The first section was developing the cross sections and flow paths of the river. 
 - The banklines were created by finding the crest of the bank line and drawing the blank lines at those points across the river. 
 - The flowlines were centered down the middle of the river.

#### Section 2: Contraction and Expansion Co-Efficients:

>  Refer to Page 3-22 for the typical values for sub-critical flow, most notably the contraction and expansion for a typical bridge is 0.3 and 0.5 respectively. **If you get the chance, learn the inherent theory behind it.**
