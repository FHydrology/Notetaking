# Cannery Creek TUFLOW Model:
### Model Run P02a_006:

The goal for this model run was to add a weir perpindicular to the flow path that permits flows into an offline sediment basin when the water level is greater than 1.7 m AHD.
> Note: An offline sediment basin is a sediment basin that is not located in the mainstream flow path. An example of this would be a basin on the side of a creek.

Design Case | P02a_006 | P02a_006_~e1~_~e2~.tcf | Geometry_Control_004.tgc | Added weir based off terrain level boundary of 1.7m AHD called **2d_zsh_De04_R.shp**. A 2d_po line was implemented on the edges of the weir to derived the Q , V and H parameters.
